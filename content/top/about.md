![](/img/rikkebarsten.jpg)  I am currently working as a data analyst at the Zealand Region in Denmark. I also like to play with data in my free time, and I have decided to share some of that with the world in this blog.

Prepare to be dissapointed if you expect weekly or even monthly updates. As a busy mom of two, there might be some time between finished projects.

I mostly work in R and Javascript (D3) and use R Studio and Visualt Studio Code as my main tools.

Althoug I am a native norwegian living in Denmark, the blog will be written in english. This is simply a matter of beeing able to interact with the worldwide R community.

The site is powered by Hugo and the blogdown R package written by [Yihui Xie] (https://yihui.name). Yihui has also written a great guide to setting up your own blog using blogdown with [Amber Thomas] (https://amber.rbind.io) and [Alison Presmanes Hill] (https://alison.rbind.io).

Finally thanks to [Huabing Zhao] (https://zhaohuabing.com/) for making the theme.
