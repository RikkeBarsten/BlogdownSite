![](/img/rikkebarsten.jpg)  I am currently working as a data analyst at the Zealand Region in Denmark. I also like to play with data in my free time, and I have decided to share some of that with the world in this blog.

As a busy mom of two, there might be some time between projects and updates. For the same reason I try to keep my projects short and my code effective, and only do stuff I really enjoy.

I mostly work in R and Javascript (D3) and use R Studio and Visualt Studio Code as my main tools. I also have experience coding in SQL, C# and VBA, but since data is my passion, and since this is a website, it will mostly be about R and D3.

Although I am a native norwegian living in Denmark, the blog will be written in english. This is simply a matter of beeing able to interact with the worldwide R community.

The site is written in R Markdown with the blogdown package and Hugo. The blogdown package is written by [Yihui Xie] (https://yihui.name). Yihui has also written a great guide to setting up your own blog using blogdown with [Amber Thomas] (https://amber.rbind.io) and [Alison Presmanes Hill] (https://alison.rbind.io). The site is served by Netlify through GitHub.

Finally thanks to [Huabing Zhao] (https://zhaohuabing.com/) for making the theme.
